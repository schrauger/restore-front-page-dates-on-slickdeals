restore-front-page-dates-on-slickdeals
======================================

An old userscript I wrote. It is no longer useful, but I wanted to save it from userscripts.org after I found it again.

http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/150750

Script Summary: This brings back the functionality of the front page to show deals by day, instead of the "deals you might have missed" blob. This is for the slickdeals.net website. 

Version: 1.2

Known issues:

* if 'expand all deals' is set in the user's preferences, the expanded deals will not line up with the headers.
* <strike>Previous day deals link to their permalink page. They do not have the javascript dropdown.</strike> Fixed in version 1.2
